    <p class="content">
      This digital collage depicts a surrealist cityscape with exposed anatomical elements and grassland. The collage imagines urban design that embraces and emulates natural and biological systems. This collage asks viewers in what ways urban design harmonizes with our environment and our bodies and in what ways it does not. The detached ureter, spilling bile in the center of the collage, prompts viewers to consider our open-loop waste disposal system specifically.

    <p class="content">
      This collage incorporates more anatomy, specifically bronchi and sphincters. The lungs and bowels, associated with breathing and waste, respectively, elicit some of the most pressing issues facing municipal design: air quality, waste disposal, sewage overflows, and water waste. In the center of the collage, an extremely saturated rock formation disrupts the uniform rectangular structures of the built environment. These rocks, like the grass floor from the previous collage, push viewers to consider what existed before and how we can develop our spaces with a deeper consideration of the preexisting land.

        Using New Art City's 3D gallery space builder I created this 3D, walkable version of my cityscape collages. I made the structures and animations in Blender before importing them into Art City's platform.

      These two watercolor and ink sketches show my initial design of the Inner Ear Chair.

      This Blender model shows a mannequin sitting in the Inner Ear Chair. I found the virtual mannequin in a library of posable 3D files. Adding the mannequin to my model helped me understand the changes needed to design a more ergonomic chair.

  <figcaption><marquee>Inner Ear Chair Model <br>↴</marquee>
    <p class="content">
      These images show a finished paper mache model of a chair based on the shape and function of the Inner Ear. The model is a foot and a half long and made entirely of recycled material (styrofoam, paper mache, clay, plastic, and glow sticks.)  Like the function of our Inner ears, the chair, if fully realized, would use the displacement of fluids in its canals to recognize changes in tilt in three dimensions. The chair would reorient itself with this information, returning the user to a reclined sitting position. This being a proof of concept model, the chair is balanced by two stones strategically inserted at its base, and the tubes serve only as visual placeholders. Making visible a system that is so central to how we navigate the world will inspire users to dig deeper into their anatomy and wonder what other complex systems perpetually work to keep them upright.

  <figcaption><marquee>Potato Experiments <br>↴</marquee>
    <p class="content">
      I created this series of potato sculptures in my final studio course at UC Santa Cruz. Students were prompted to find a material, play with it, and push the boundaries of its form and structure. In my experiments, I carved potatoes, sculpted their mash, stacked them, and let their exposed skins dry to a wooden-like exterior.

  <figcaption><marquee>Potato Final <br>↴</marquee>
    <p class="content">
      After experimenting with a variety of methods, I decided, for my final potato sculpture, I would insert armature wire into a stack of potatoes and bend them into impossible shapes. These three potato structures were inspired by Ugo Rondinone’s colorful rock stacks and Erwin Wurm’s one-minute sculptures.

This short clip is a sample of the work I did for Professor Dee Hibbert Jones and her partner, Nomi Talisman, on their forthcoming animated film, Run With It. Like their previous project, Last Day of Freedom, Run With It deals with topics of systemic racism, incarceration, and the death penalty.

      <p class="content">
        I did this illustration after a short stint living in the suburbs outside Los Angeles. After returning, I mused about the strange arid landscape I had escaped from and what it might look like as water becomes more scarce and temperatures rise.

  <figcaption><marquee>Black Chair <br>↴</marquee>
      <p class="content">
        This 3D-printed chair was based on Gerrit Rietveld's 1918 design, The Red Blue Chair. This appropriately named sculpture explored modular design, both as a means of efficiently 3D printing and as a means of allowing users to reconfigure and fix the design.
